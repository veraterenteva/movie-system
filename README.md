### Movie data prediction

This project was completed as a part of ITMO Data Science course. The **parser** part completes unparalleled parsing of raw IMDB pages to extract data regarding movies.   
Then **movie_rating_predictor** can predict ratings based on genre, TV-certificates, etc. It runs LGBM and contains implementation for custom LGBM (almost from scratch)    
Finally, **movie_desciptor_predictor** contains code implementation of a simple transformer and also addresses GPT to show the other way of description prediction.
